How developers use Find Usages to understand and compare method uses and how better IDE support might help? When working in large and complex codebases, developers face challenges using Find Usages to understand how to reuse classes and methods We found that developers often wasted time reading long lists of similar usages or prematurely focused on a single usage. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that clustering usages by the similarity of their surrounding context might enable developers to more rapidly understand how to use a function.
