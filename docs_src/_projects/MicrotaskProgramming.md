In microtask programming, developers complete short self-contained microtasks through the use of 
a specialized programming environment. Given only a textual description of the purpose of a function and its implementation, 
a developer might be asked to identify, test, and implement a new behavior. To complete larger programming tasks, microtasks may 
be automatically generated and aggregated. 
Microtask programming is envisioned to offer a number of benefits, including reduced time onboarding developers onto a project and 
faster time-to-market through greater parallelism.
